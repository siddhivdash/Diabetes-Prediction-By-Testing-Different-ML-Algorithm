# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes using different machine learning algorithms. The model is trained on the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, and the performance of various classifiers is evaluatedâ€”after applying **hyperparameter tuning**â€”to determine the most accurate prediction model.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects millions worldwide. Early detection can help in timely treatment and lifestyle changes. This project tests the effectiveness of multiple classification algorithms and compares their performance to choose the best-performing model.

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Tested & Tuned

The following machine learning algorithms were trained, tuned, and evaluated:

- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**
- **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**

### âœ… Hyperparameter Tuning

Each model was fine-tuned using `GridSearchCV` and manual testing to identify the best parameters for optimal accuracy and generalization.  
Example tuning parameters:
- **SVC:** `C`, `kernel`, `gamma`
- **Decision Tree:** `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, `criterion`
- **BernoulliNB:** `alpha`, `binarize`

After evaluation, **SVC** showed the highest prediction accuracy and was selected as the final model.
